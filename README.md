# Spring Boot Project - Udemy Course User and Posts

This repository contains the source code for a Spring Boot project developed as part of a Udemy course. The main goal of this project is to apply and reinforce the concepts learned during the course, including creating a RESTful API, managing data persistence with JPA and H2, and implementing Spring Boot’s core features.

## Features:

- **REST API**: Build a fully functional RESTful API for managing resources.
- **Data Persistence**: Integration with Spring Data JPA and H2 database to handle data storage and retrieval.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for different entities.
- **Dependency Injection**: Use Spring’s powerful dependency injection capabilities for modular and testable code.
- **Exception Handling**: Implement global exception handling for better error management.
- **Spring Boot DevTools**: Leverage hot reload for faster development cycles.

## Technologies:

- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot 3.4.0**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **H2 Database**
- **Maven**

## Getting Started:

To run this project locally, clone the repository and build the project using Maven. You can use the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) by default.

## Goals of the project:
- Understand the basics of Spring Boot and how it simplifies the development of Java applications.
- Gain hands-on experience building APIs and connecting them to databases.
- Explore advanced Spring features like dependency injection, AOP, and exception handling.

Feel free to fork the repository and contribute to the project!
